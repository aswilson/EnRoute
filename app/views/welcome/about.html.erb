<h2>About EnRoute</h2>

<p>EnRoute is the result of a semester-long group project in Designing Human Centered Software in the Human-Computer Interaction department at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2015.</p>
<p> EnRoute is a web application designed to greatly expand upon basic navigation functionality, which usually requires set destinations in set orders for use. Competitor map applications are limited in this way or have been poorly created, making them quick to crash and thus difficult to use. EnRoute goes further in assisting users, helping them to plan their day, find unexpected destinations in addition to intended ones, and get directions. Upon creation of an account, users are able to input a list of combined tasks and stops in a set or arbitrary order. EnRoute then develops potential destinations and routes to provide the best options for the user to meet their needs. Manual reordering of stops and looking up places in an area with specific services are no longer necessary. Tasks and stops can be vague as “Coffee” or specific as “Starbucks” or “100 Dark Roast Road,” and favorited locations are saved and prioritized in the giving of directions. Suggestions for unexpected, interesting stops along the way are also provided in case of extra time or the desire for a spur of the moment activity. Currently EnRoute is available for navigation and exploration in the Pittsburgh area, and further expansion into more regions and mobile applications are still to come.
